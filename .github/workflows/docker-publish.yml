      # QEMU is a generic and open source machine & userspace emulator and virtualizer.
      # Buildx is a Docker CLI plugin for extended build capabilities with BuildKit.
      # It provides the same functionality as docker build with many new features.
      # The docker/setup-qemu-action action sets up QEMU for use in GitHub Actions.
      # The docker/setup-buildx-action action sets up Docker Buildx for use in GitHub Actions.
      # The docker/build-push-action action builds and pushes Docker images to a registry.

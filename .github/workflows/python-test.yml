# GitHub Actions workflow to build, lint, and test a python app
# Author: Wolf Paulus (https://wolfpaulus.com)
#
# This workflow will install Python dependencies, run tests and lint with a single version of Python
# For more information see: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-python
# Your sources need to be in the "./src" folder, your tests in the "./tests" folder

# CI/CD

Both Git fork and clone create copies of a repository, but they offer drastically different levels of access, isolation and control over the target repo. The key difference between Git clone and fork comes down to how much control and independence you want over the codebase once you've copied it.

Any public Git repository can be forked or cloned. A fork creates a completely independent copy of Git repository. In contrast to a fork, a Git clone creates a linked copy that will continue to synchronize with the target repository.

Please understand that there are **TWO** kinds of settings:
1. Account Settings
1. Repository Settings 
## Fork this repository
Login to your github account and search for this repo: **wolfpaulus/wordgame** .. cick on it.

**_Fork_** this repo to your own github account.
You can do this by clicking on the "Fork" button in the upper right corner of this page.
Keep the Repo name as is, i.e. ```wordgame```, and copy the main branch to your own repo. I.e., click on the green "Create fork" button.

## Pull the repo to your local machine
Open VSCode, select 'File/New Window' and select 'Clone Git Repository'. Finally, provide the URL to your forked repo. E.g.: https://github.com/[Your_Github_Username]/wordgame

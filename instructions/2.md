# CI/CD

### Test and run the Python application
1. Install a virtual environment: open the Command Palette (⇧⌘P), search for the Python: Create Environment command, and select it ... like explained here: [Python environments in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments)
1. pip install the dependencies (see requirements.txt files). E.g.,
open a terminal (CTRL`) .. make sure the virtual environment is activated (venv) and execute: 
    - ```pip install -r ./requirements.txt``` 
    - ```pip install -r ./tests/requirements.txt```
1. Run the tests
    - ```pytest```
1. Launch the app locally. E.g.,
    - ```python -m streamlit run src/app.py  --server.port=8000 --server.address=localhost```
1. Observe the app running: http://localhost:8000

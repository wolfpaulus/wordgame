# CI/CD
## Local Repository
### Github Action
 The ./github/workflows directory contains three workflows:
 1. python-test
 1. docker-publish

#### python-test
This workflow runs everytime a commit is pushed to github.
Should autopep8 linting succeed, pytest runs. Only if pytest succeeds without failiures will the other two workflows run.

#### docker-publish
This workflow build a docker image and puiblishes is in the GitHub Container Registry. Since this repository in public, the [container image](https://github.com/users/wolfpaulus/packages/container/package/wordgame) is publically available as well.

The most important part of the `docker-publish.yml` file is that it builds a multi-platform container for linux/amd64 andlinux/arm64/v8
I found the following resources very helpful:
